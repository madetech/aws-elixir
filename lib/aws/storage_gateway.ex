  AWS Storage Gateway Service

  AWS Storage Gateway is the service that connects an on-premises software
  appliance with cloud-based storage to provide seamless and secure
  integration between an organization's on-premises IT environment and AWS's
  storage infrastructure. The service enables you to securely upload data to
  the AWS cloud for cost effective backup and rapid disaster recovery.

  Use the following links to get started using the *AWS Storage Gateway
  Service API Reference*:

  <ul> <li> [AWS Storage Gateway Required Request
  Headers](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/AWSStorageGatewayAPI.html#AWSStorageGatewayHTTPRequestsHeaders):
  Describes the required headers that you must send with every POST request
  to AWS Storage Gateway.

  </li> <li> [Signing
  Requests](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/AWSStorageGatewayAPI.html#AWSStorageGatewaySigningRequests):
  AWS Storage Gateway requires that you authenticate every request you send;
  this topic describes how sign such a request.

  </li> <li> [Error
  Responses](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/AWSStorageGatewayAPI.html#APIErrorResponses):
  Provides reference information about AWS Storage Gateway errors.

  </li> <li> [Operations in AWS Storage
  Gateway](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/APIReference/API_Operations.html):
  Contains detailed descriptions of all AWS Storage Gateway operations, their
  request parameters, response elements, possible errors, and examples of
  requests and responses.

  </li> <li> [AWS Storage Gateway Regions and
  Endpoints](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/index.html?rande.html):
  Provides a list of each of the s and endpoints available for use with AWS
  Storage Gateway.

  </li> </ul> <note> AWS Storage Gateway resource IDs are in uppercase. When
  you use these resource IDs with the Amazon EC2 API, EC2 expects resource
  IDs in lowercase. You must change your resource ID to lowercase to use it
  with the EC2 API. For example, in Storage Gateway the ID for a volume might
  be `vol-1122AABB`. When you use this ID with the EC2 API, you must change
  it to `vol-1122aabb`. Otherwise, the EC2 API might not behave as expected.

  </note> <important> IDs for Storage Gateway volumes and Amazon EBS
  snapshots created from gateway volumes are changing to a longer format.
  Starting in December 2016, all new volumes and snapshots will be created
  with a 17-character string. Starting in April 2016, you will be able to use
  these longer IDs so you can test your systems with the new format. For more
  information, see [Longer EC2 and EBS Resource
  IDs](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/#longer-ids).

  For example, a volume ARN with the longer volume ID format will look like
  this:

  `arn:aws:storagegateway:us-west-2:111122223333:gateway/sgw-12A3456B/volume/vol-1122AABBCCDDEEFFG`.

  A snapshot ID with the longer ID format will look like this:
  `snap-78e226633445566ee`.

  Gateway volume and snapshot IDs coming in
  2016](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/ann.jspa?annID=3557).

  is corrupted or removed from the gateway. When a cache is reset, the
  gateway loses its cache storage. At this point you can reconfigure the
  disks as cache disks.

  <important> If the cache disk you are resetting contains data that has not
  been uploaded to Amazon S3 yet, that data can be lost. After you reset
  cache disks, there will be no configured cache disks left in the gateway,
